Upgrading
---------

When a new version of ContainDS Dashboards or related components is released, the upgrade process may depend on your JupyterHub configuration.

Please see any specific notes in the :ref:`changelog` - for example, changes may be required to your jupyterhub_config.py file.

In general, you just need to remember to upgrade both your hub and user environments. If you only have one environment in your installation, you 
should run *both* the hub and user upgrade commands in your environment.

Especially in containerised environments (Docker or Kubernetes), existing singleuser servers may need to be deleted. They can be recreated by re-accessing 
the dashboard through the Dashboards page.


LocalProcessSpawner or SystemdSpawner
=====================================

In the hub environment:


.. parsed-literal::

    pip install --upgrade cdsdashboards==\ |cds_version|
    # or
    conda install -c conda-forge cdsdashboards=\ |cds_version|


Also upgrade in the user environment, with some extra dependencies:


.. parsed-literal::

    pip install --upgrade cdsdashboards[user]==\ |cds_version|
    # or
    conda install -c conda-forge cdsdashboards-singleuser=\ |cds_version|


DockerSpawner
=============

In the hub environment:

.. parsed-literal::

    pip install --upgrade cdsdashboards==\ |cds_version|
    # or
    conda install -c conda-forge cdsdashboards=\ |cds_version|


Your singleuser image will also need to be upgraded.

For example, if using a pre-built image, in your jupyterhub_config.py:

.. parsed-literal::

    c.DockerSpawner.image = 'ideonate/containds-allr-datascience:|cds_version|'


If you are using your own image, please rebuild it, specifying the updated 
version numbers where appropriate.

The Littlest JupyterHub
=======================

Upgrade the cdsdashboards package in the hub environment:

.. parsed-literal::

    sudo -E /opt/tljh/hub/bin/python3 -m pip install cdsdashboards==\ |cds_version| 


Also upgrade cdsdashboards in the user environment, including extra dependencies:

.. parsed-literal::

    sudo -E /opt/tljh/user/bin/python3 -m pip install cdsdashboards[user]==\ |cds_version| 


Kubernetes (Z2JH)
=================

In your config.yaml file, update to the latest tags of the images used - both hub and singleuser.

Here is an example snippet from a config.yaml:

.. parsed-literal::

    hub:
      allowNamedServers: true
      image:
        name: ideonate/cdsdashboards-jupyter-k8s-hub
        tag: |z2jh_helm_version|-|cds_version|
    
    ...
    
    singleuser:
      image:
        name: ideonate/containds-allr-datascience
        tag: |cds_version|
    

If you are using your own images, please rebuild them, specifying the updated 
version numbers where appropriate.
